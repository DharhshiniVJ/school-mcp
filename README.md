# School Management System — MCP + Agentic AI

A secure, full-stack School Management System built with a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** architecture, a multi-layer **ReBAC security pipeline**, and a local **Ollama LLM** for natural language database interactions.

---

## ? Key Features

- ?? **Agentic AI Chat** — Natural language interface backed by a tool-calling LLM loop
- ?? **6-Layer Security Architecture** — Gateway secrets ? JWT ? Tool whitelists ? Role guards ? ReBAC pipeline ? MongoDB user privileges
- ??? **Database-Level Security** — Dedicated MongoDB users per role with collection-level least-privilege grants
- ?? **Multi-Environment** — Separate staging and production databases with environment-specific privilege policies
- ?? **Automated Security Test Suite** — Programmatic integration tests verifying all ReBAC boundaries

## ?? Security Architecture

The system implements **6 independent enforcement layers**, each acting as a standalone barrier:

| Layer | Location | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Gateway Secret** | MCP Server startup | Ephemeral `randomUUID()` shared between gateway and subprocess — blocks any direct MCP client |
| **2. JWT Verification** | Every tool call | Role and identity extracted and verified from signed token |
| **3. Tool Whitelist** | Ollama service | LLM only receives tools valid for the user role — cannot call what it cannot see |
| **4. `requireRole()` Guard** | Every tool handler | Server-level hard block before any DB access |
| **5. ReBAC Pipeline** | `security/pipeline.ts` | Relationship-based access: teachers only see their classes, students only see their own marks |
| **6. MongoDB User Privileges** | Database level | `app_student`, `app_teacher`, `app_admin` users with collection-level grants; **production admin cannot delete classes at DB level** |

---

## ?? Environment Policies

| Capability | Staging | Production |
|---|---|---|
| Delete classes | ? allowed | ? blocked at DB level |
| Destructive pipeline commands | ? allowed | ? blocked |
| JWT expiry | 24h | 2h |
| Sanitation / Firewall / ReBAC | ? | ? |

## ?? Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker Desktop
- An Ollama instance (local or via Google Colab + Ngrok — see below)

### Step 1: Clone & Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd school-mcp
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### Step 2: Configure Environments
```bash
cp environments.example.yaml environments.yaml
```
Edit `environments.yaml` and fill in your passwords, JWT secrets, and Ollama endpoint.
> `environments.yaml` is listed in `.gitignore` — your credentials will never be committed.

### Step 3: Start Databases
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Wait a few seconds for the containers to be fully ready before continuing.

### Step 4: Set Up Database Auth (run once)
Creates role-scoped MongoDB users with least-privilege grants. **Docker must already be running (Step 3) before this step.**
```bash
node scripts/setup-db-auth.cjs
```

### Step 5: Seed Staging Data
`npm run build:server` compiles the TypeScript source into `server/dist/` first. The seed script then populates the staging database with sample users, classes, and marks.
```bash
npm run build:server
npm run seed
```

### Step 6: Run Security Tests
```bash
npm run verify
```
All assertions must pass. ?

### Step 7: Start the Gateway
```bash
npm run start:gateway
```

### Step 8: Start the Frontend
```bash
cd client && npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173`

## ?? LLM Setup — Google Colab + Ngrok (Recommended)

Running a large model locally on CPU can be slow. For fast inference, offload to a free Colab GPU:

**In Google Colab (GPU runtime):**
```python
# Install and start Ollama
import os, subprocess, time
os.environ['OLLAMA_HOST'] = '0.0.0.0'
subprocess.Popen(["ollama", "serve"])
time.sleep(3)
```
```bash
!curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
!ollama pull qwen2.5:14b
```
```python
# Expose via Ngrok
!pip install pyngrok
from pyngrok import ngrok
ngrok.set_auth_token("YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN")
tunnel = ngrok.connect(11434, "http")
print("Endpoint:", tunnel.public_url)
```

Then set `ollama.endpoint` in your `environments.yaml` to the Ngrok URL.

For **local Ollama**, set `ollama.endpoint` to `http://localhost:11434` instead.

| Admin | `admin@school.edu` | `admin123` |
| Teacher | `teacher.alice@school.edu` | `teacher123` |
| Student | `student.charlie@school.edu` | `student123` |
